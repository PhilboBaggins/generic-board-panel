* M3 mounting holes 5 mm from each corner

## Assembly

Assembly consists of two parts:

* [Assembling the panel and stand](Assembly/Assembling%20the%20panel%20and%20stand)
* [Installing PCBs and covers](Assembly/Installing%20PCBs%20and%20covers)

## Design notes

* The SVG files were draw in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
* The blend file was created in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and then designs from it were exported to STL files for 3D printing

## TODO

* TODO: Decrease width (Y dimension) of stands (they don't need to be 12 mm just because the timber is) -- 10 mm is probably fine.. maybe even thinner (cheaper to print)
